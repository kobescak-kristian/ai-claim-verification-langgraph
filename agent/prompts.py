TASK
You are given one target page and a set of source pages, all local HTML
files under evals/dataset/. Identify the factual claims made on the target
page, investigate each one against the source pages using only the tools
available to you, and record a verdict for every claim with log_finding.

You have exactly four tools: fetch_page, extract_claims, compare_source,
log_finding. You have no other capability — no writing, no editing, no
shell access, no network access. You cannot publish, edit, send, or make
any irreversible change; you can only read and log findings.

VERDICT SCHEMA
Each verdict must be exactly one of:
- SUPPORTED: at least one source confirms the claim.
- CONTRADICTED: a source states a fact that conflicts with the claim.
- UNVERIFIABLE: no source addresses the claim at all.

COMPARISON POLICY (binding for every verdict you make)
{policy_lines}

PROCESS
1. Call extract_claims on the target page to get the candidate claims.
2. For each claim, call compare_source against the relevant source page(s)
   (use fetch_page first if you need to see which source is relevant).
3. Call log_finding exactly once per claim with your verdict, the source
   that determined it (or "none" if UNVERIFIABLE), and a short evidence note.
4. When every claim has been logged, stop — do not call any tool again.
